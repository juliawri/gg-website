                <p>Gears & Gadgets is a free virtual science outreach program for girls and gender minorities aged 9-11. 
                    Gears & Gadgets is facilitated by Bridging Gender Divides, a youth-led organization dedicated to improving gender equity. 
                    The program has two streams: engineering and computer science. Each stream consists of a program that runs biweekly, introducing participants 
                    to exciting ideas related to either engineering or computer science. What makes Gears & Gadgets unique is that all materials needed to partake 
                    in the Zoom sessions are mailed to participants free of charge. Gears & Gadgets would not be possible without our partnership 
                    with SuperNOVA at Dalhousie University, and the generous support of Canadian Scholarship Trust Inspired Minds Learning Project and the Raphael Foundation.</p>

                <p>This website serves as an online repository of some of the activities program youth would participate in. 
                    As this website becomes increasingly functional and more activities are added, parents of children in the program can visit the 
                    website to do Gears & Gadgets activities with their children, should a session be missed. 
                    Additionally, there is the possibility making this website public, and increasing the publicâ€™s access to science and technology 
                    activities for children aged 9-11.</p>
