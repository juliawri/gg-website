                    <p>Tape the straw along the top of the tube with a little bit hanging off to pierce through the cardstock. Decorate the circle (the participants can do this with their coloured pencils/crayons). Place the circle onto the straw with the design facing the toilet paper roll. Look into the kaleidoscope to see all the reflections created by the design.</p>

                    <h2>What is Light?</h2>
                    <p>Light is a type of radiation (like what an X-ray machine uses) which is detectable by your eye. Light can come from many different places, such as the sun, stars, or lights in your room.</p>

                <div class="kaleidoscope__card__discussion">
                    <h2>What Direction Does Light Usually go In?</h2>
                    <p>Light typically travels in a straight line until it bumps into something. This could be anything from a tree outside, to the mirrors in your package, to you! Often light will be absorbed into the object, meaning that the light doesnâ€™t come out of the other side of the object. However, sometimes it will be reflected, such as in the case of mirrors, or refracted, meaning the light is bent.</p>

                <div class="kaleidoscope__card__discussion">
                    <h2>Does Light's Direction Change Inside the Kaleidoscope?</h2>
                    <p>Light does go into your kaleidoscope and it changes direction each time it reflects off the mirrored sheets in your device.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="kaleidoscope__card__discussion">
                    <h2>Why is There a Design in Your Kaleidoscope?</h2>
                    <p>In many kaleidoscopes, there are objects like beads or sparkles at the end of the kaleidoscope that the light can reflect off of. In your kaleidoscope, the light might not reflect off the objects at the end but your design will look different through the kaleidoscope because the light has reflected off of the mirrors.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="kaleidoscope__card__discussion">
                    <h2>What About Looking Into the Kaleidoscope from a Different Direction?</h2>
                    <p>You will very likely see something different at the end of your kaleidoscope when you face a different direction because the light will be hitting the kaleidoscope mirrors in a different direction. This occurs because your light source (for example, your lamp) stays the same while you turn, meaning the light will come at the kaleidoscope from a different angle.</p>
